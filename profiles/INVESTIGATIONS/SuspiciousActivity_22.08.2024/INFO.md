List extracted from the article. Complete list has 476 entries, however some accounts became inactive before data dump was performed, therefore only 350 profiles is backed up.

Accounts in `part1` follow the old gh-fake-analyzer data schema, `part2` dump was performed with new schema. Adjust data processing accordingly.

This is the same investigation as LargeFakeNetwork_23.08.2024, however additional accounts were mapped.

This is a part of a broader investigation cycle by Heiner including:
